<h1> Art can Heal</h1>

<p>
Most people use art as a way to express themselves, simply because sometimes, pictures can portray more than words. 
There are so many different forms of art. Through dance, you can express your emotions. Through music you can fee them.
Art is all about letting all that's inside escape and letting it free. In the modern world where time is of the essence
and working is essential, something like art is necessary to have. Rather than doing art because you have to, one should 
realize that art is fun and isn't limited to painting or sculpting, but more over an entirely different world we can escape 
to any time.

<p>
Sometimes it is hard for people to talk about their problems, which is why they use art to relieve them of their emotions. 
Others use art to portray things they feel matter. Things like inequality, world hunger, and lack of education are popular topics that
artists design things for to spread awareness.
