    <h1>The Purpose</h1>

<p> The goal of this website is really to spread awareness about how art is being overlooked continously and no one seems to notice
    because they think it is alright. Certain subjects are prioritzed over art and this shouldn't be the case. It is also meant to 
    try and convince people who disregard art as important to think otherwise. Art can affect both the people and the world in a 
    very positive way and more people should recognize that.
