    <h1>The Importance of Art</h1>


    <p>When art comes to mind, most people think of paintings and such.
        But all the landmarks in the world that we hold dear to our culture is art in its scaled form.
        Art is the very being of our history. The Eiffel Tower in France and the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
        Imagine if art didn't exist. Life would be so dreary and bleak. We wouldn't stop to admire a nice scenery because we 
    wouldn't see the point of it. Our culture is filled with art. We used to convey messaged through drawings and we used design
to make something to prevent from freezing in the snow. </p>

<p>Rather than trying to fit the idea that art is made up of mere paint and paper, we should try and relate to everyday things for students
    We should be showing them how things like design and math fit together to build anything. If a building were to be designed such that
    it wouldn't be blown over by strong winds, that depends completely on the design of it. We are told that we can find science and math
    in our everyday lives. And we can also find just as much art and design all over the world. 
</p>
